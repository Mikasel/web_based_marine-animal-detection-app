# Web Based Marine Animal Detection App

This project is a web application designed to detect marine animals in images uploaded by users. It utilizes a machine learning model (likely YOLO or a similar object detection model) to identify various marine species.

## Features (Example - Please update)

*   User-friendly web interface for image uploads.
*   Real-time (or near real-time) detection of marine animals in uploaded images.
*   Display of bounding boxes and labels for detected animals.

## Getting Started (Example - Please update)

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.x
*   Pip (Python package installer)
*   Git

**Installation & Running:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mikasel/web_based_marine-animal-detection-app.git
    cd web_based_marine-animal-detection-app
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    # (You'''ll need to create a requirements.txt file if you haven'''t already)
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python webapp.py 
    # (Or whatever your main application script is named)
    ```
    Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the port specified by your app).

## Technologies Used (Example - Please update)

*   Python
*   Flask (or your chosen web framework)
*   YOLO (or your chosen detection model)
*   HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)

## To-Do / Future Enhancements (Example)

*   Support for video uploads.
*   Detection of a wider range of marine species.
*   User accounts and image galleries.
